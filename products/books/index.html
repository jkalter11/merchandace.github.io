		<h3>Ace of Hearts: A Journey to Embracing the Asexual Identity</h3>
		<p>Asexuality (an orientation where someone does not experience sexual attraction) is widely misunderstood. Or worse: ignored. Until it becomes common knowledge that asexuality exists as a sexual orientation, then people who DO relate on the spectrum will continue to struggle internally (feeling alone, broken, or flawed) and externally (in relationships, and life in general). The Lonely Ace of Hearts begins with a general introduction about asexuality as an orientation, debunking the most common myths, and then guides readers through the most common struggles. Defining and Understanding Your Identity. Achieving Self-Acceptance. Coming Out to Friends &amp; Family. (Or, not.) Dealing with Loneliness. Love, Dating, Sex, and Relationships. This is not about “dealing with life as an asexual”. This is about (ultimately) Embracing the Asexual Identity. By Caryn Purdy.</p>

		<h3>The Invisible Orientation: An Introduction to Asexuality</h3>
		<p>What if you weren’t sexually attracted to anyone? A growing number of people are identifying as asexual. They aren’t sexually attracted to anyone, and they consider it a sexual orientation–like gay, straight, or bisexual. Asexuality is the invisible orientation. Most people believe that “everyone” wants sex, that “everyone” understands what it means to be attracted to other people, and that “everyone” wants to date and mate. But that’s where asexual people are left out–they don’t find other people sexually attractive, and if and when they say so, they are very rarely treated as though that’s okay. When an asexual person comes out, alarming reactions regularly follow; loved ones fear that an asexual person is sick, or psychologically warped, or suffering from abuse. Critics confront asexual people with accusations of following a fad, hiding homosexuality, or making excuses for romantic failures. And all of this contributes to a discouraging master narrative: there is no such thing as “asexual.” Being an asexual person is a lie or an illness, and it needs to be fixed. In The Invisible Orientation, Julie Sondra Decker outlines what asexuality is, counters misconceptions, provides resources, and puts asexual people’s experiences in context as they move through a very sexualized world. It includes information for asexual people to help understand their orientation and what it means for their relationships, as well as tips and facts for those who want to understand their asexual friends and loved ones. By Julie Sondra Decker - better known in the ace community as <a href="http://swankivy.com/">swankivy</a>.</p>

		<h3>Understanding Asexuality</h3>
		<p>Asexuality can be defined as an enduring lack of sexual attraction. Thus, asexual individuals do not find (and perhaps never have) others sexually appealing. Some consider “asexuality” as a fourth category of sexual orientation, distinct from heterosexuality, homosexuality, or bisexuality. However, there is also recent evidence that the label “asexual” may be used in a broader way than merely as “a lack of sexual attraction”. People who say they have sexual attraction to others, but indicate little or no desire for sexual activity are also self-identifying as asexual. Distinct from celibacy, which refers to sexual abstinence by choice where sexual attraction and desire may still be present, asexuality is experienced by those having a lack or sexual attraction or a lack of sexual desire. More and more, those who identify as asexual are “coming out,” joining up, and forging a common identity. The time is right for a better understanding of this sexual orientation, written by an expert in the field who has conducted studies on asexuality and who has provided important contributions to understanding asexuality. This timely resource will be one of the first books written on the topic for general readers, and the first to look at the historical, biological, and social aspects of asexuality. It includes firsthand accounts throughout from people who identify as asexual. The study of asexuality, as it contrasts so clearly with sexuality, also holds up a lens and reveals clues to the mystery of sexuality. By Anthony F Bogaert.</p>
